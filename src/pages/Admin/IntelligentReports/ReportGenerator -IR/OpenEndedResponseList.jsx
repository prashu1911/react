        <h4 className="reportSubTitle">What additional resources or tools would enhance your ability to perform your job more effectively, and how could they be implemented?</h4>
        <p className="mb-3">To enhance my ability to perform my job more effectively, additional resources such as an advanced project management tool and upgraded hardware would be highly beneficial. For instance, adopting a tool like Trello or Asana would significantly improve task tracking and team collaboration. Additionally, upgrading our current computers to more recent models with faster processors and additional RAM would help in handling more complex tasks efficiently.</p>
        <p className="mb-3">The new project management tool would streamline task assignments, monitor progress more effectively, and facilitate better communication among team members. This would lead to more organized workflows and quicker project completion. Upgrading the hardware would reduce lag and increase productivity, allowing me to work more efficiently on resource-intensive tasks.</p>
        <p className="mb-3">Training sessions would be arranged for the new project management tool to ensure that everyone can use it effectively. Additionally, support would be provided to address any technical issues that arise with the new hardware.</p>
        <p className="mb-3">First, we would evaluate different project management tools to select the one that best fits our needs. Following this, we would purchase and set up the tool, ensuring all team members have access.</p>
