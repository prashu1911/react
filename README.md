# Metolius React

A React-based web application bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Git

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd metolius-react
```

2. Configure environment variables:
```bash
# Rename .env.example to .env
cp .env.example .env

# Update API_BASE_URL in .env with your API URL
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### Development

```bash
npm start
```
This runs the app in development mode:
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser
- The page will automatically reload when you make changes
- Lint errors will appear in the console

### Testing

```bash
npm test
```
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. [Learn more about running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder:
- Bundles React in production mode
- Optimizes the build for best performance
- Minifies files and includes hashes
- Ready for deployment

### Eject

```bash
npm run eject
```

⚠️ **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you need full control over the build tools and configuration, you can `eject` at any time. This copies all configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project. All commands except `eject` will continue to work, but they'll point to the copied scripts for customization.

Ejecting isn't necessary for most deployments. The default configuration works well for small to medium projects.
